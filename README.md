Exercise 1
----------
This folder contains packages for a publisher and a subscriber. Moreover, png format pictures are included of the plots (both rqt and plotjuggler).

Exercise 2
----------
The second folder contains data visualization scripts, and a saved picture of the plot results. There is some simple extra optional functionality, such as a real time implementation. The scripts also depend on the packages:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib

To install Numpy for python (on Ubuntu), simply use

`sudo apt install python-numpy`

To install Matplotlib (also for Ubuntu), use

`sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib`

To subsequently run the scripts, navigate to where they are located. Then in the terminal write \<python animate.py\>.
